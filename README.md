# Rock Paper Scissors Image Classification
Lintasarta Cloudeka Digischool x Dicoding Basic Machine Learning

1. Dataset source : https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip
2. Build using TensorFlow, Keras Library, and Sequential Model
3. The dataset is divided into train set and validation set with a validation set weight of 40%.
4. Applied Image Augmentation process and use Image Data Generator
5. The model is created by using the Sequential model
6. Model training is accelerated by using GPU on Google Colab Runtime so that the program can learn samples in less than 30 minutes.
7. Image prediction accuracy of the model is 98% to 99%
